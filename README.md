This is a 42 school project where the goal is gaining access to a system with the given ISO. 

We decided to present our work in the form of a **penetration testing report**, divided into three detailed parts:

1. **Information gathering**: Cover the attack surface and identify the exploitable service.
2. **Exploitation**: Get initial access to the system.
3. **Post Exploitation**: Escalate privileges and get root access.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è We can't share the ISO file due to school policy restrictions
