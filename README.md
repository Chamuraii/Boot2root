# 👨‍💻 Boot2Root
This is a 42 school project where the goal is gaining access to a system with the given ISO. We decided to upload our writeups in the form of a penetration testing report with 3 detailed parts:

1. **Information gathering**: Cover the attack surface and identify the exploitable service.
2. **Exploitation**: Get initial access to the system.
3. **Post Exploitation**: Escalate privileges and get root access.

> The ISO file can't be uploaded for policy restrictions
