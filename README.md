This is a 42 school project where the goal is gaining access to a system with the given ISO. 

We decided to present our work in the form of a **penetration testing report**.

[writeup1.md](./writeup1.md)

1. **Information gathering**: Cover the attack surface and identify the exploitable service.
2. **Exploitation**: Get initial access to the system.
3. **Post Exploitation**: Escalate privileges and get root access.

[writeup2.md](./writeup2.md)

1. **Alternative privilege escalation**: Gain root access using a different method.
